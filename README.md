> You must have heard about the self-driving cars in which the passenger can fully depend on the car for traveling. But to achieve level 5 autonomous, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.

In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.

In this Python project example, i builded a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.I n this Python project , i have successfully classified the traffic signs classifier with 95% accuracy and also visualized how the accuracy and loss changes with time, which is pretty good from a simple CNN model.




**********************************************************************************

# DataSet Used
The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

# Libraries Used :
Setting up your development environment
Installation of:
- install python 3.10.7
- pip install numpay
- pip install tensorflow
- pip install keras
- pip install cv2
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install tkinter

# Steps

1)Explore the dataset

2)Build a CNN model

3)Train and validate the model

4)Test the model with test dataset
